         Create an HTML page with two buttons that argue with each other. When one
         button is clicked, the text "I'm right" should be placed next to it. When
         the other button is clicked, the text is replaced with, "No, I'm right!"
    -->
    <div id="ans"></div>

    <button onclick="right()">I'm right!</button>
    <button onclick="noMe()">No, I'm right!</button>

    <!--
         Create an HTML page with a large element on the page that says
         "Don't hover over me" inside of it.  When you hover over the element, send
         an alert to the user that says, "Hey, I told you not to hover over me!
    -->
    <div id="dontHover" onmouseover="dontHover()">
      Don't hover over me

    <!--
         Create an HTML page with a form. It should include inputs for a username,
         email, and password. Also a submit button. In a Javascript file, write a
         program which checks the following things:
         a. checks that the password is 12345678
         b. if the password is incorrect, send an alert message
         c. Your page should also include an <h1> tag. If the information in the form
         is correct, have Javascript change the text in the <h1>.HTML page. It should
         include inputs for a username, email, and password. Also a submit button.
    -->
    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>Type in username and password then hit submit:</p>

    <form action="">
      User name:<br>
      <input type="text" name="userid" id="userid">
      <br>
      Email:<br>
      <input type="text" name="email" id="email">
      <br>
      User password:<br>
      <input type="password" name="psw" id="psw">
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" onclick="event.preventDefault(); validate();">
    </form>


    <!--
         BONUS: Create an HTML page with a form that asks the user to input the value
         of a sphere's radius. Write Javascript that gives them back the volume of
         the sphere. (There are many different ways to execute this. You can give the
         user information back in another input box on the page, as an alert, or any
         other way you can think of. You can look up how to use the Javascript Math
         object to simplify your calculations.)

    -->
    <h2>Bonus: Volume of Sphere</h2>
    <h3>(Enter input into box and then click somewhere else on the screen to finish.)</h3>
    Radius of Sphere:
    <input type="text" name="radius" id="radius">
    <br>
    Volume of Sphere:
    <div id="volume"></div>

    <!--
         We include the javascript file at the end since it has event listeners,
         which require elements to already be loaded into DOM.
    -->
    <script src="script.js"></script>
